# CyberAwar3

# About
This is a website that I am building to hopefully teach others more about cybersecurity.
There will be lessons on the basics such as some of the key terms as well as some of the major breaches in the past and what can be learned from them.
There will also be links to helpful websites where you can learn about breaches, cybersecurity, as well as some blogs to follow. 
The page is still in beta and planning, so there is much to improve on.
